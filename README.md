# SimpleStoryMapJS

A lightweight, programmer-friendly alternative to [StoryMapJS](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS/) that strips away the editor and backend, leaving just the essentials for building narrative maps.

## Motivation

The original StoryMapJS is an excellent tool for non-programmers, providing a full authoring platform where users can create and edit story maps without touching code.   However, this approach comes with trade-offs: opinionated design choices, hardcoded solutions, and a heavier technical stack.

SimpleStoryMapJS takes a different approach. It's "simple" from a programmer's perspectiveâ€”just HTML, JavaScript, JSON, and CSS.  No backend, no database, no build process.  Just create a JSON file defining your story and you're done.

## Key Benefits

- **Modern mapping libraries**: Use MapLibre GL JS or other contemporary mapping tools instead of being locked into legacy solutions
- **Flexible hosting**: Take advantage of new technologies like PMTiles for efficient, serverless map tile hosting
- **Direct control**: Edit your story map configuration directly in JSON with full control over every aspect
- **Free and open**: Easier to use completely free mapping and tile hosting solutions
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, fast loading, easy to customize

## Who Is This For?

SimpleStoryMapJS is ideal for developers who:
- Want full control over their story map implementation
- Prefer working directly with code rather than using a visual editor
- Need to integrate story maps into existing web applications
- Want to use modern mapping libraries and tile hosting solutions

If you're a journalist, educator, or non-technical user looking for a point-and-click solution, the [original StoryMapJS](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/StoryMapJS/) is probably a better fit.
